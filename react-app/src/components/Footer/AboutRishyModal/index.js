      <h4>About Rishy.</h4>
      <p>Welcome to Rishy, a music sharing social media platform where users can post songs they're currently listening to, along with an image that encapsulates their present feelings. The emotional experience of listening to a song can be significantly enhanced with the visuals of an image. We at Rishy believe that sharing music can be a way to build strong personal relationships and foster special close-knit communities.</p>
      <p>
      This capstone is dedicated to my best friend Rishi Malani, who loved nothing more than sharing and conversing about the power of music.
